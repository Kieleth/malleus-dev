# Malleus paper v4 source-grounded review record, protocol v3

This is run-24's blank record, written by
`paper-v4/evaluation-v4/run-24/build_review_inputs.py` from the frozen v3
template. The question ids are this cell's frozen competency question file's,
in that file's order. The row and witness counts are figures of a producer
that has not run and are filled by the same script at freeze; no other
placeholder survives either stage.

Copy this file for the review and edit only the JSON block. `BLANK` and
`PRELIMINARY_COMPLETE` are not paper evidence; Luis must ratify.

The `questions` block below carries one entry per question of the cell's
competency question file, 30 of them, in that file's order. Write one
`witnesses` entry per distinct witness the query result returns,
416 in all, and reference it from every row that shares it.
Rows: 158 rows for `CQ-T1-01`, 158 for `CQ-T1-02`, 128 for `CQ-T1-03`, 55 for
`CQ-T1-04`, 158 for `CQ-T1-05`, 98 for `CQ-T2-01`, 228 for `CQ-T2-02`, 243
for `CQ-T2-03`, 301 for `CQ-T2-04`, 29 for `CQ-T2-05`, 212 for `CQ-T3-01`,
228 for `CQ-T3-02`, 228 for `CQ-T3-03`, 222 for `CQ-T3-04`, 216 for
`CQ-T3-05`, 68 for `CQ-T4-01`, 68 for `CQ-T4-02`, 80 for `CQ-T4-03`, 243 for
`CQ-T4-04`, 49 for `CQ-T4-05`, 196 for `CQ-T5-01`, 228 for `CQ-T5-02`, 212
for `CQ-T5-03`, 212 for `CQ-T5-04`, 244 for `CQ-T5-05`, 212 for `CQ-C-01`,
197 for `CQ-C-02`, 291 for `CQ-C-03`, 158 for `CQ-C-04`, 228 for `CQ-C-05`,
5348 in all.

Three things the validator derives or forbids, so that writing them wrong is
refused rather than recorded:

- `question_responsiveness` is derived from `coverage`. Write the label the
  derivation produces, `COVERED` when every required semantic names a row,
  `NONE` when none does, `PARTIAL` otherwise. A label the derivation does not
  produce is refused.
- A witness whose `resolution` is `LOCATOR_NOT_RESOLVABLE` carries
  `source_support` `NOT_EVALUABLE`, never `PARTIAL` and never `UNSUPPORTED`,
  and says in its `rationale` what did not resolve.
- `assembly` is a descriptor, not a grade. It never moves a label.

On a `STRUCTURED_ROWS` cell every witness carries `resolution` and cites
locators of the form `<source_id>#row:N:field`. On a
`SELECTED_READING_TEXT_LAYER` cell no witness carries `resolution` and every
locator is a reading block id. Copy no source passage or source row into this
record beyond the locator, and add no numerical aggregate.

Each `witnesses` entry has this shape on a `STRUCTURED_ROWS` cell:

```
{
  "witness_key": "invoice:I1",
  "source_support": "SUPPORTED | PARTIAL | UNSUPPORTED | NOT_EVALUABLE",
  "resolution": "VALUE_MATCHES_ROW | VALUE_DERIVED_FROM_ROW | VALUE_DIFFERS_FROM_ROW | LOCATOR_NOT_RESOLVABLE",
  "source_locators": ["source:small-shop:invoices#row:0:invoice_id"],
  "rationale": "one or two sentences in your own words"
}
```

and this shape on a `SELECTED_READING_TEXT_LAYER` cell, with no `resolution`
key and the fixed tokens the task defines at the head of the `rationale`:

```
{
  "witness_key": "obs:instrument-count",
  "source_support": "SUPPORTED | PARTIAL | UNSUPPORTED | NOT_EVALUABLE",
  "source_locators": ["page:2:block:004"],
  "rationale": "DIGEST_OK SUBJECT_IN_BLOCK one or two sentences in your own words"
}
```

Each `rows` entry names a returned row and the witness it shares:

```
{
  "row_index": 0,
  "witness_key": "invoice:I1"
}
```

Each `coverage` entry names one required semantic and either the row that
carries it or one typed reason it is absent:

```
{
  "semantic": "instrument_count",
  "row_index": 3,
  "absent_reason": null,
  "note": ""
}

{
  "semantic": "instrument_count",
  "row_index": null,
  "absent_reason": "NOT_MODELLED | WITHHELD_STATEMENT | UNREACHED_RECORD | NOT_IN_SOURCE | LOCATOR_NOT_RESOLVABLE",
  "note": "why, in your own words"
}
```
